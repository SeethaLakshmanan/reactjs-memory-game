# Memory game with Christmas-themed cards

The purpose of this memory game is to memorize the locations of the cards in the game and make pairs of cards by turning them over. When the 2 cards match, it's a valid pair and they are removed from the board. Otherwise the cards are automatically turned face down and you have to try again.

The game is available in 3 difficulty levels (Easy, Medium and Hard) and you can start the game by selecting any one of them.
